# Gender-Recognition-using-CNN-from-Scratch
We used CNN for predicting gender among 60 speakers (30 males and 30 females), we designed the CNN from scratch without using any tensorflow or keras library and got 93.47% accuracy when classifying the gender of speakers that the model had never hear before.

the problem was to learn how to manipulate audio data and build model to classify sounds.

we did a lot of research to understand how to solve the problem and how a lot of people have tackled the problem.

In this approach we converted the audio clips to pictures(mel spectrogram) and used those images to train a convolutional neural network model (CNN).
